Problem Solving 13 : Infinite Loop post authentication

Problem Statement:
After successful authentication in the application, users are redirected back to the login page or the authentication endpoint repeatedly, resulting in an infinite loop. 
This behavior prevents users from accessing the intended resource or home page after login.

The issue typically occurs due to missing or incorrect handling of session state, tokens, or redirect URLs after authentication. 
Instead of routing the user to the intended destination, the application re-triggers the authentication process, creating a continuous loop.

Possible Causes:

Session or Token Not Persisted:
The authentication response is successful, but the session or token is not stored correctly, causing the system to think the user is unauthenticated.

Missing Redirect URI or Default Landing Page:
The application does not have a proper post-login redirect URI, sending the user back to the login page instead.

Incorrect Configuration in Authentication Provider (e.g., SAML, OAuth):
Mismatch or misconfiguration in SSO settings (e.g., ACS URL, RelayState, callback URL) may lead to failed or misrouted post-login flows.

Client-Side Issues (Cookies or Local Storage):
Session cookies or tokens are not being stored due to browser settings, domain mismatches, or misconfigured SameSite attributes.


Solution:
✅ Step 1: Verify Authentication Response
Confirm that the authentication provider (e.g., Identity Provider, OAuth Server) returns a valid token or SAML assertion.

Use browser dev tools or logs to inspect the response.

✅ Step 2: Check Session/Token Persistence
Ensure that the session or token is properly stored on the client (e.g., cookies, localStorage).

Check for any client-side restrictions (e.g., browser blocks third-party cookies).

✅ Step 3: Review Post-Login Redirect Logic
Confirm the application is correctly redirecting to a valid and accessible URL after authentication.

If using SSO, verify that RelayState or post-login redirect URIs are correctly set.

✅ Step 4: Inspect Application Logs
Look for authentication success followed by unexpected redirects or 302 loops.

Logs often reveal missing session data or failed state restoration.

✅ Step 5: Adjust Load Balancer or Proxy Configurations (if any)
Ensure sticky sessions or session persistence are correctly configured.

Check for any reverse proxy headers that may affect authentication routing.

✅ Example Fix:
For a SAML-based SSO loop issue:

Ensure ACS (Assertion Consumer Service) URL is correct.

Include RelayState during login initiation and correctly handle it on return.

Set 'Include Certificate in keyInfo' to true, if signature validation fails.
