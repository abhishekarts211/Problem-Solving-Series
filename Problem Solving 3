Problem Solving 3 : Troubleshooting Page Expired Error

Troubleshooting "Page Expired" Errors in PingFederate SSO Redirects

Overview
During Single Sign-On (SSO) flows with PingFederate, users may occasionally encounter a "Page Expired" error. This typically happens when PingFederate cannot find the session information it needs to continue the login process.

Why Does This Happen?
PingFederate relies on two key pieces of information to manage a user's session:

Session Cookie â€“ A small file stored in the userâ€™s browser (usually named PF by default) that tracks session data.

Resumable Nonce â€“ A unique identifier for each session, embedded in the URL.
For example, in this URL:
https://<hostname>/idp/WDe3q/resumeSAML20/idp/startSSO.ping,
the "WDe3q" part is the nonce.

If either of these is missing or invalid, PingFederate can't proceedâ€”and shows the "Page Expired" error page.

Common Causes & Solutions
1. Cookie Issues
If the browser drops or blocks the PingFederate session cookie (PF) during the authentication flow, the session breaks.

2. HTML Form Double Submission
Sometimes users might click the login button more than once, causing the form to be submitted multiple times. This can confuse PingFederate and cause the session to expire.

Note: While this usually happens with the HTML Form IdP Adapter, it can occur with other setups too.

3. HTML Form State Expiry
If users spend too long on the login page before clicking "submit", the session state may expire before PingFederate can process it.

4. Multiple Simultaneous Authentication Requests
If a user opens several SSO links at once (e.g., in multiple browser tabs), it can cause conflicts that lead to the Page Expired error.

5. Clustering Issues
In rare cases, a problem in communication between nodes in a PingFederate cluster may cause session data to get lost.

6. State Purged Before Expiry
Even if the session hasn't technically expired, it can be purged early from the server's state table. This is uncommon, but it can still lead to a Page Expired error.

7. Bookmarking In-Flight URLs
If a user bookmarks a resume URL or shares it as a way to start an SSO login, PingFederate will reject it as the session state is no longer valid.
