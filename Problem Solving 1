Problem Solving 1 : Kerberos Failure 

High-level review of how Kerberos authentication is working with PingFederate:


A browser-based authentication request is sent to PingFederate.

PingFederate invokes the Kerberos IdP adapter (or IWA IdP adapter) as configured (e.g., based on authentication policy).

PingFederate responds with the WWW-Authenticate: Negotiate header, challenging the browser to provide a Kerberos or NTLM token.

The browser queries DNS using the hostname to determine the Service Principal Name (SPN).

Using the SPN, the operating system requests a service ticket from the Domain Controller/Key Distribution Center (DC/KDC) by exchanging the user's Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT).

The DC/KDC returns the service ticket, which the browser includes in the request to PingFederate as the Authorization header.

PingFederate validates the Kerberos token with the DC/KDC.

Upon successful validation, PingFederate retrieves the user's identity from the token and completes the authentication process.
