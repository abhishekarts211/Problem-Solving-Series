Problem Solving 7: Cookie Domain Conflict in PingFederate – Managing PF Cookie Duplication Across Hosts


Introduction
PingFederate uses cookies to manage and maintain user sessions. These cookies play a vital role in ensuring secure and consistent authentication flows. However, when managing multiple virtual hosts or domains, misconfiguration of cookie domain settings in session-cookie-config.xml can lead to duplicate cookies and unpredictable behavior.

This article explores the PingFederate cookie domain issue, the implications of incorrect domain configurations, and how to properly resolve it to maintain clean, conflict-free session handling.

The Problem: Duplicate PingFederate (PF) Cookies

Observed Behavior
When the <cookie-domain> value is explicitly set in the session-cookie-config.xml file, PingFederate starts appending a domain to the Set-Cookie header. This can lead to duplicate PF cookies under certain conditions.

Example Scenario
Default cookie behavior:


Set-Cookie: PF=zOv4xxmzDI2rx1TFBFy78X; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly
After setting cookie-domain to .abc.com:


Set-Cookie: PF=zOv4xxmzDI2rx1TFBFy78X; Domain=.abc.com; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly
Now, if a user visits the authentication system through multiple subdomains (e.g., federation.abc.com and certauth.abc.com), two PF cookies may be stored by the browser:

One for federation.abc.com

One for .abc.com

Resulting Error
With multiple PF cookies in the browser, PingFederate can struggle to identify which one is authoritative. This leads to:

Session conflicts
Authentication errors
Inconsistent login behavior across tabs or domains

Root Cause: Cookie Scoping Misconfiguration

Understanding Cookie Domains

When a cookie is set without a domain, it is scoped to the exact domain that issued it (e.g., federation.abc.com).

When a cookie is set with a domain like .abc.com, it becomes accessible to all subdomains under abc.com.

Why This Causes Duplication
If you access PingFederate via:

https://federation.abc.com
https://Certauth.abc.com

And your browser receives two cookies:

One scoped to .abc.com
One scoped to federation.abc.com

The browser will send both cookies in subsequent requests. PingFederate receives multiple PF cookies, resulting in session ambiguity and authentication failure.

Resolution Steps
To prevent duplication and ensure consistent session management, follow these steps:

✅ 1. Edit the Cookie Domain Configuration

<pf_install>/pingfederate/server/default/data/config-store/session-cookie-config.xml
Update the <cookie-domain> to a single, unambiguous value — typically a shared parent domain:

<c:item name="cookie-domain">.abc.com</c:item>
This ensures a single PF cookie is used across all subdomains.

✅ 2. Replicate the Configuration
After editing:

Save the file.
Replicate the updated configuration to all PingFederate nodes.

✅ 3. Restart PingFederate
Restart the PingFederate service to apply the changes.

Expected Outcome
Once the fix is applied:

PingFederate sets the cookie using the defined domain:


Set-Cookie: PF-Prod=aDfPx6uwbbWGFhwE6zEhEG; Domain=.abc.com; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly
Only one PF cookie will be used across all relevant hosts.

Session handling becomes stable and predictable.

Best Practices for Cookie Management in PingFederate
Use a common parent domain (.example.com) only when you need seamless SSO across subdomains.

Avoid setting different cookie domains on environments where users access multiple hosts.

Regularly review browser-stored cookies during testing to confirm only one PF cookie is active.

Conclusion
Setting a cookie domain in PingFederate is essential for multi-host environments but must be done carefully. Misconfigured domain scoping can lead to duplicate PF cookies, which in turn causes session conflicts and authentication failures.

By properly setting the <cookie-domain> value and maintaining consistent domain access patterns, organizations can ensure that PingFederate delivers seamless, secure session management across all subdomains.
