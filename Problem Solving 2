Problem Solving 2 : Signature Validation failed

Troubleshooting “Signature Validation Failed” in PingFederate SSO config

Common Causes
=====================

Mismatched Certificates
------------------------

The SP does not have the correct public key (certificate) of the IdP.

The IdP changed its certificate and didn’t notify the SP.

Metadata Not Updated
--------------------

SP or IdP is using outdated federation metadata.

Recent metadata changes (like key rotation) weren’t propagated.

Incorrect Signing Algorithm
--------------------------------

The IdP is using a signing algorithm not supported or not configured in the SP (e.g., RS512 vs RS256).

Corrupt or Altered SAML Response
-----------------------------------

The response was tampered with or got corrupted in transit (e.g., whitespace issues or encoding anomalies).

Relay State or ACS URL Mismatches
----------------------------------

Although not directly causing signature validation failure, mismatched request/response details can lead to indirectly related errors.




Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Guide
🔍 1. Review the PingFederate Logs

server.log

saml-trace.log

audit.log


📄 2. Verify the IdP Certificate
Go to:

PingFederate Admin Console > Identity Provider > IdP Connections > [Your Connection] > Signature Verification

Ensure the public certificate (X.509) matches what the IdP is using to sign messages.

Tip: If you receive metadata from the IdP, import it again to refresh keys.

🔄 3. Update Metadata
If your IdP provides a metadata URL or XML file:

Re-import it in PingFederate:
IdP Connections > Metadata > Import Metadata

Make sure to check:

entityID

SingleSignOnService URL

KeyDescriptor use="signing"

🔧 4. Check Signing Settings
Ask your IdP:

Are they signing the assertion, the response, or both?

Which algorithm are they using (e.g., SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512)?

Ensure PingFederate is configured to accept the expected algorithm under:
SP Connections > Signature Verification

🧪 5. Use SAML Tracer Tools
Use browser extensions like:

SAML-tracer (Firefox/Chrome)

Fiddler

Download the SAML response and decode it (using tools like SAMLTool) to:

Confirm signature presence

Validate the certificate fingerprint

Check for encoding errors

🔁 6. Reproduce the Error in Lower Environments
Try to replicate the flow in a staging or QA environment. This helps isolate whether it’s an environment-specific issue, such as an outdated certificate in just one PingFederate node.



Preventive Best Practices
Enable automatic metadata refresh if supported by your IdP.

Set alerts for certificate expiry and rotate keys before expiration.

Regularly test SSO flows post any update or certificate change.

Maintain direct communication channels with external IdP/SP parties.
