Problem Solving 11 : Signature didn't validate against the credential's key 


Problem Statement:

During SSO configuration, the system fails to validate the SAML response signature against the credential's key, resulting in a persistent validation error. 
Initially, the signature algorithm was updated from RSA-SHA1 to RSA-SHA256 in an attempt to resolve the issue. However, the error remained unresolved.

Error Details:

Caused by: org.opensaml.xml.validation.ValidationException: Signature did not validate against the credential's key
	at org.opensaml.xml.signature.SignatureValidator.validate(SignatureValidator.java:79)
	at ch.nevis.esauth.auth.states.saml.util.Verifier.verifyXMLSignature(Verifier.java:714)



Solution:

Navigate to Digital Signature Settings under the SSO connection configuration.
Set "Include Certificate in keyInfo" to True.

This ensures that the SAML response includes the certificate in the signature's KeyInfo element, enabling proper validation of the signature against the credentialâ€™s key.
