Problem Solving 4 : Getting 403 at OpenID userinfo endpoint

Problem Statement: OIDC Integration – UserInfo Endpoint Failing with 403 Error
During the implementation of Single Sign-On (SSO) using OpenID Connect (OIDC), the vendor successfully completes the authorization code flow up to obtaining the access token. However, the request to the userinfo endpoint fails with an HTTP 403 Forbidden error.

Observations:
Authorization Code: ✅ Successful

Access Token Retrieval: ✅ Successful

Call to userinfo endpoint: ❌ Fails with HTTP 403

This indicates the access token might lack the necessary scope or permissions to access the userinfo endpoint.

Root Cause
The issue was caused by an incorrect or incomplete scope parameter in the initial authorization request. Specifically, the required scopes to access user claims (openid, profile, and email) were either missing or misspelled.

Solution
Ensure that the authorization request URL includes the correct and complete scopes. For access to the userinfo endpoint, the openid scope is mandatory, and additional scopes like profile and email are needed to fetch corresponding user claims.

✅ Correct Format:
https://<host-address>/as/authorization.oauth2?client_id=<client-id>&response_type=code&scope=openid%20profile%20email

❌ Incorrect Format (e.g., typo or case mismatch in scope):
https://<host-address>/as/authorization.oauth2?client_id=<client-id>&response_type=code&Scope=openid%20profile%20email

Note: The parameter name scope is case-sensitive and must be spelled correctly. Also, all required scopes must be included without typos.
