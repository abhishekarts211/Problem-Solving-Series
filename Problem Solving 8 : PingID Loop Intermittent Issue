Problem Solving 8 : PingID Loop Intermittent Issue


Problem Statement
Multiple users intermittently encountered an MFA loop that prevented access to SSO-based applications integrated with PingID. 
The issue manifested as an inability to complete authentication, where users were repeatedly redirected to the MFA registration portal, even if already registered.

Incident Timeline & Observations
Initial Reports ‚Äì Incidents raised by a user facing PingID authentication issues.

The issue resolved itself within a minute, pointing to a potential network-level glitch.

Later the same day, a Senior Director reported similar behavior‚Äîbeing redirected to the MFA portal after PingID failure.

Early Investigation
PingFederate server logs indicated:

Cannot connect to authenticator endpoint (authenticator.pingone.com)

PingID service status was operational at the time.

Based on the system design, if PingID is unreachable, PingFederate redirects to the MFA registration portal.

For registered users, this causes a loop, as they have no registration step to complete.

Escalation & Multi-Team Involvement

Multiple teams involved:

SSO Operations
Network & Perimeter Security
Ping Identity Support

Network team confirmed no issue on network path between:

Source: PingFederate on-prem servers
Destination: PingID (authenticator.pingone.com)


Major Incident logged

Problem Record opened for root cause analysis

Technical Investigation and Data Collection

What Was Gathered:

CSD Files from PingFederate
Server logs with SSL debug: -Djavax.net.debug=all
Rolling Wireshark captures
Kibana reports showing failure patterns across QA & PROD
Java connectivity probe:
Custom Java program hitting PingID heartbeat endpoint every 30 seconds
Captured intermittent connectivity drop
NIC Status Reports (netstat -e) before and after incidents
Firewall traffic validation
SSL Interception check ‚Äì ruled out by perimeter team
Java version and cert path validation

Findings From Ping Identity Investigation

What Was Ruled Out:

No issue with PingID or PingOne infrastructure
No problem on the PingFederate Java/OS/NIC layer
No handshake or cipher suite mismatch
No SSL interception in outbound traffic
No packet loss or NIC congestion on PF side
Handshake failures started early (ClientHello sent ‚Üí RST received)

What Was Discovered

Wireshark captures revealed:

ClientHello sent from PF server
No ServerHello received
Instead, RST (Reset) packets sent back to PF

The RST was not from PingID, but from an intermediate device within infrastructure
The Cisco Nexus device (identified by MAC) issued the RST, not PingID
The same failure reproduced in QA and PROD, both using shared infra


Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

üîç Root Cause Summary

A firewall rule removal during a routine cleanup caused intermittent blocking of PingID traffic.

Detailed RCA:

PingID object group (GLB_PINGID_Authentication) removed from https-allowed group
Automation script misidentified PingID as unused due to a bug, and the object was removed during firewall cleanup under Change Request.

Change was executed successfully and removed 829 objects, including PingID

Misidentification occurred because PingID was treated as a single IP instead of a load-balanced set

No recent hits were seen on that specific IP in the last 60 days ‚Üí marked as unused

Resolution:

Firewall team restored the PingID object group into the https-allowed group
Verified communication between PF and PingID resumed
No further MFA loop incidents observed post fix

Lessons Learned & Recommendations


üìå Future Prevention
Review and enhance firewall cleanup automation scripts:

Add logic to treat PingID and other load-balanced or CDN-based services properly

Introduce approval workflows for removing security objects used in authentication

Conduct controlled simulations before executing production rule changes



Conclusion:

The PingID MFA loop issue was caused by a firewall misconfiguration due to faulty automation logic during a cleanup activity. 
This led to intermittent resets of SSL connections between PingFederate and PingID, which resulted in login loops. 
The issue was resolved after 13 days of cross-functional investigation and restoration of the removed firewall objects.
