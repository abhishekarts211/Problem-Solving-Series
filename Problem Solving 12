Problem Solving 12 : Stickiness session in AWS


Problem Statement:
In an AWS environment, session stickiness (also known as session affinity) is configured on the load balancer to maintain user sessions by directing 
requests from the same client to the same target. The load balancer achieves this by issuing a cookie with a defined stickiness duration.

Currently, the stickiness duration is set to 8 hours. After this period, the cookie expires, and the session is no longer sticky. 
This can lead to inconsistent user experience or session-related issues for long-running sessions, especially in applications that expect persistent 
connections beyond the configured time frame.



Solution:

To maintain stickiness for longer sessions or prevent session drops:


Adjust the Stickiness Duration:

Navigate to your AWS Load Balancer settings.

Under the target group associated with the load balancer, locate the Stickiness settings.

Increase the duration based on your applicationâ€™s session requirements (e.g., more than 8 hours if needed).


Use Application-Controlled Session Stickiness (Optional):

Instead of relying solely on the load balancer, configure your application to manage its own session affinity using custom cookies.

This provides more control and flexibility over session management logic.
